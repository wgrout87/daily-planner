# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This repository contains a webpage for a work day scheduler. Text can be input for each hour of the working day. Varying background color provides a visual cue indicating whether the hour has passed, is present, or is in the future. These backgrounds update on load, as well as every hour on the hour.

Technologies used include HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and JQuery.

## Features
* The current date is displayed at the top of the screen
* Text entered in the scheduler can be saved so that it persists and will be returned whenever the page is loaded
* A new day will provide a blank slate where previously saved entries will be cleared
* Altering the text of the scheduler whithout saving will cause the save buttons to flash red until the change has been saved
* Background cues update automatically denoting the relationship of the planned hour to real time
